.SH NAME
twopence_command \- execute a test command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B twopence_command [
.I OPTION
.B ]... 
.I TARGET
.B  
.I COMMAND

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B twopence_command
executes a command on the system under test (SUT).
.PP
The SUT can be accessed by any means provided by a Twopence
plugin: virtio (for QEmu/KVM virtual machines), ssh, or serial
(with a null-modem cable). This access method and the exact
location of the SUT are defined by the
.I TARGET
parameter. With the virtio and serial methods, the program
.B twopence_test_server
must be installed and running on the SUT. With the ssh method,
a SSH server must be installed and running on the SUT.
.PP
The command can be run as any local user on the SUT (default is
.I root
user). There is absolutely no access control, so make sure you
use Twopence only on test machines on which you have exclusive
access.
.PP
During the command's execution, stdin, stdout, and stderr are
redirected, so you can see the remotely executed command's
behaviour and provide it with input if it requires some.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-u\fR\ \fIUSERNAME\fR
.IP\fB\-\-user\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Define the username under which to run the command
on the system under test.
.IP \fB\-o\fR\ \fIFILENAME\fR
.IP \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
Store the results in the given file.
Both stdout and stderr go to that file, in apparition order.
Options \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-1\fR/\fB\-2\fR, and \fBq\fR are mutually exclusive.
.IP \fB\-1\ \fIFILENAME1\fR\ \fB\-2\ \fIFILENAME2\fR
.IP \fB\-\-stdout\ \fIFILENAME1\fR\ \fB\-\-stderr\fR\ \fIFILENAME2\fR
Store the results separately, stdout going to the first file, and
stderr going to the second file.
Options \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-1\fR/\fB\-2\fR, and \fBq\fR are mutually exclusive.
.IP \fB\-q\fR
.IP \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not output anything, apart from the error codes.
Options \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-1\fR/\fB\-2\fR, and \fBq\fR are mutually exclusive.
.IP \fB\-h\fR
.IP \fB\-\-help\fR
Display a short error message.
.PP
.I TARGET
obeys the following syntax:
.PP
.IP \fBvirtio:\fR\fISOCKETNAME\fR
for the access through virtio to
a QEmu/KVM virtual machine. \fISOCKETNAME\fR is the filename of
the UNIX domain socket used by the virtio channel. It can be defined
for example with help of
.BR virt-manager (5)
command.
.PP
.IP \fBssh:\fR\fIHOSTNAME\fR|\fIIPADDRESS\fR\fB[:\fR\fIPORTNUMBER\fR\fB]\fR
for the access though SSH to a remote host.
.PP
.IP \fBserial:\fR\fIDEVICENAME\fR
for the access through a serial port. \fIDEVICENAME\fR is the filename
of a UNIX character device describing the serial port.
.PP
.I COMMAND
is the command to run. It is provided as a single argument,
so make sure to quote it if it contains spaces.

.SH FILES
.I /usr/lib/twopence/twopence_test_server
.RS
The server to be installed on the system under test when using
the virtio or serial access methods.

.SH EXAMPLES
Example syntax for the virtio plugin:
.IP \fBtwopence_command\ \-u\ johndoe\ virtio:/tmp/sut.sock\ "ls\ \-l"\fR
it will use
.I /tmp/sut.sock
to communicate with the QEmu/KVM host.
.PP
Example syntax for the ssh plugin:
.IP \fBtwopence_command\ \-\-user=johndoe\ ssh:host.example.com\ "ls\ \-l"\fR
it is functionally equivalent to
\fBssh\ johndoe@host.example.com\ ls\ \-l\fR
so it is not very interesting when used from the shell...
.PP
Example syntax for the serial plugin:
.IP \fBtwopence_command\ serial:/dev/ttyS0\ "ls\ \-l"\fR

.SH BUGS
Do not expect any security from Twopence. Use with care. You've been warned.
.PP
For the moment, only one session with the remote host can be used at
a time.
.PP
For the moment, the serial port speed and parity have to be set up
by some other utility, like
.BR minicom (1)
.
