Custom protocol
===============

The virtio and serial plugins use a custom protocol to communicate with
the system under tests.


Packet structure:

  Byte 0        Packet type
  Byte 1        (reserved for future use - "port" number)
  Byte 2        length, high order byte
  Byte 3        length, low order byte
  Byte 4+       data


Packet types:

        local => system under tests
  'c'           run command
  'i'           insert file
  'e'           extract file
  'q'           quit
  '0'           stdin
  'E'           end of file on stdin
  'I'           interrupt command

        system under tests => local
  'M'           major error code
  'm'           minor error code
  '1'           stdout
  '2'           stderr
  'T'           command timeout
  'E'           end of file during extract transaction

            both directions
  'd'           file data

The length includes the 4 bytes of the header.


Parameters are separated with spaces:

  run command   username timeout command
  insert file   username filesize filename
  extract file  username filename
