BUGS
   o library, shell and ruby wrappers:
     buffer allocation errors are not handled anymore
     (calloc() returning NULL)

   o test server:
     Display used port when using --audit
     Make --audit the default

   o The serial/virtio protocol has no request/reply matching.
     Proposed fix: add a new field to the header that is a timestamp.
     Two-way exchange of transaction IDs might be a bit too complicated.

   o Re-enable "line timeout"
     Add option to set it (see below)


REFACTORING
   o in ssh.c, replace
       ssh_channel_read_nonblocking() + nanosleep()
     with
       ssh_channel_select()

   o not sure there is much point in having two concurrent APIs to do the same:
     refactor shell and ruby wrappers to use directly twopence_run_test()?
     [DONE for shell/command.c]


FUNCTIONALITY
   o write help pages
     Ruby
     Python
     write manpages: twopence(3), twopence(3py)

   o minimalistic options for the twopence_exit command
     -h --help -v --version

   o accept a directory as destination filename for inject and extract
   o be able to inject or extract a full directory tree
     -r --recursive

   o be able to tune the line timeout for receiving the results
     -s --silence

   o when injecting files, be able to set up the permission mask
     -m --mask

   o be able to pass environment variables to remote command
     -e --envvar

   o be able to run tests in parallel
     (using a "port number")
 
   o integration with Pennyworth

   o real docbook documentation, reusing the README as a starting point

   o handle interrupts during file transfers,
     not only during command execution

   o ssh.c: kill the remote command when it was aborted
     because of a timeout or another problem

   o Document the tests we're doing in tests/


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
   o Twopence could be extended by writing new plugins,
     for example for running tests in Linux containers or chroot jails

   o it could also be extended by writing new programming language wrappers
     (Perl, Java...)
