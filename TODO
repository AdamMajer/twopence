BUGS
   o Python:
     target.Command("cat");
     does not react as a local "cat", while it should
     (interactive test)

   o library, shell and ruby wrappers:
     buffer allocation errors are not handled anymore
     (calloc() returning NULL)

   o test server:
     no more information about what is being done by the server
     injects sometimes fail

   o Makefiles:
     "make clean" leaves files behind


REFACTORING
   o plugins:
     get rid of twopence_init, replaced by twopence_init_new
     (just a matter of comments?)

   o in ssh.c, replace
       ssh_channel_read_nonblocking() + nanosleep()
     with
       ssh_channel_select()

   o not sure there is much point in having two concurrent APIs to do the same:
     refactor shell and ruby wrappers to use directly twopence_run_test()?


FUNCTIONALITY
   o write help pages
     Ruby
     Python
     write manpages: twopence(3), twopence(3py)

   o display a short help message for the twopence_exit command
     -h --help

   o display the version of the library
     -v --version

   o accept a directory as destination filename for inject and extract
   o be able to inject or extract a full directory tree
     -r --recursive

   o be able to tune the line timeout for receiving the results
     -s --silence

   o when injecting files, be able to set up the permission mask
     -m --mask

   o be able to pass environment variables to remote command
     -e --envvar

   o be able to run tests in parallel
     (using a "port number")
 
   o integration with Pennyworth

   o real docbook documentation, reusing the README as a starting point

   o handle interrupts during file transfers,
     not only during command execution

   o ssh.c: kill the remote command when it was aborted
     because of a timeout or another problem


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
   o Twopence could be extended by writing new plugins,
     for example for running tests in Linux containers or chroot jails

   o it could also be extended by writing new programming language wrappers
     (Perl, Java...)
