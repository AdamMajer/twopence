TODO
   o in ssh.c, replace
       ssh_channel_read_nonblocking() + nanosleep()
     with
       ssh_channel_select()

   o write Ruby help pages

   o split into several packages
     libtwopence0
     twopence-client
     rubygem-twopence-client
     twopence-server

   o display a short help message for the twopence_exit command
     -h --help

   o display the version of the library
     -v --version

   o accept a directory as destination filename for inject and extract
   o be able to inject or extract a full directory tree
     -r --recursive

   o be able to tune the timeout for receiving the results
     -t --results-timeout
   o add a timeout for executing a command
     -T --command-timeout

   o be able to set up the permission mask
     -m --mask

   o be able to append commands received to a log file
     -l --log

   o be able to run tests in parallel
     (using a "port number")
 
   o integration with Pennyworth

   o real docbook documentation, reusing the README as a starting point

   o handle interruptions during file transfers,
     not only during command execution


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
   o Twopence could be extended by writing new plugins,
     for example for running tests in Linux containers or chroot jails

   o it could also be extended by writing new programming language wrappers
     (Python, Perl, or Java, why not)
