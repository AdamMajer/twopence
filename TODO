BUGS
   o Mention --debug option in shell/*.1 manpages

   o server: in open_file_as, be careful with user accounts
     that have no home directory set, or have "/" as home.

REFACTORING
   o not sure there is much point in having two concurrent APIs to do the same:
     refactor shell and ruby wrappers to use directly twopence_run_test()?
     [DONE for shell/command.c]

FUNCTIONALITY
   o write help pages
     Ruby
     Python
     write manpages: twopence(3), twopence(3py)

   o minimalistic options for the twopence_exit command
     -h --help -v --version

   o chat scripts:
   	support send_eof() to close stdin
	support collecting everything between now and the
		receipt of the next expect string

   o accept a directory as destination filename for inject and extract
   o be able to inject or extract a full directory tree
     -r --recursive

   o currently, only shell/command supports the --keepalive option
     Not sure whether it makes sense to also support this in the
     other shell commands, as the only reason to add it to command(1)
     was the ability to test keepalives...

   o when injecting files, be able to set up the permission mask
     -m --mask

   o integration with Pennyworth

   o real docbook documentation, reusing the README as a starting point

   o handle interrupts during file transfers,
     not only during command execution
     Note from okir: this should be next to trivial for the virtio target,
     but may require a bit more work for ssh.

   o Document the tests we're doing in tests/

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
   o Twopence could be extended by writing new plugins,
     for example for running tests in Linux containers or chroot jails

   o it could also be extended by writing new programming language wrappers
     (Perl, Java...)
